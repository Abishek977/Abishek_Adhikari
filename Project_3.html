                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project aims to identify optimal locations for new healthcare facilities in Bharatpur, Nepal, by employing Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) combined with geospatial technologies. The study integrates factors such as population density, road accessibility, slope, proximity to existing hospitals, and land use/land cover (LULC) to create a composite suitability map that highlights the best potential sites for healthcare facilities.</p>
                <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To assess spatial gaps in current healthcare service distribution.</li>
                    <li>To identify the most suitable locations for new health facilities using geospatial analysis.</li>
                    <li>To address accessibility issues in underserved areas of Bharatpur.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sentinel-2A Imagery (10-meter resolution)</li>
                    <li>Digital Elevation Model (DEM)</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Study Area</h3>
                <p>The study focuses on Bharatpur, located in Nepal's Chitwan District, with a population of 369,377 (2021 census). The area covers 433 kmÂ² and features a rapidly growing urban population that demands more healthcare services.</p>

            <div class="findings">
                <h3>Site Suitability Analysis</h3>
                <p>The analysis incorporated five criteria: population density, proximity to existing hospitals, slope, road accessibility, and land use/land cover (LULC). Using AHP and GIS tools, the criteria were weighted based on their importance, and a composite suitability map was generated.</p>
                <h3>Key Results</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>13.25% of the study area was found to be unsuitable for new healthcare facilities.</li>
                    <li>12.38% of the area was highly suitable, located in underserved regions lacking healthcare access.</li>
                    <li>The central region of Bharatpur, which is highly urbanized, shows the greatest need for new facilities.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Conclusions & Recommendations</h2>
        <p>The study concludes that the current distribution of healthcare facilities in Bharatpur is imbalanced, with the central regions being well-served and peripheral areas underserved. The use of geospatial technologies and MCDA helped identify highly suitable locations for new facilities. It is recommended that new facilities be established in areas that have high population density but lack access to existing healthcare services. Strategic planning, based on geospatial data, is essential to improve healthcare access and reduce spatial inequality.</p>
