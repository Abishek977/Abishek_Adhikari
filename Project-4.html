                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project analyzes the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Butwal City, Nepal, over a period of nearly a decade. Using geospatial data from 2014 to 2023, we track the increasing land surface temperature (LST) and identify the factors that contribute to the urban heat problem. This analysis reveals how rapid urbanization has led to higher temperatures, especially in built-up areas, and discusses possible mitigation strategies.</p>
                <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assess the spatial and temporal changes in land surface temperature (LST).</li>
                    <li>Identify the major drivers of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Butwal.</li>
                    <li>Provide data-driven recommendations for urban planning and heat mitigation.</li>

                <h3>Urban Heat Island Growth</h3>
                <p>The analysis showed a significant rise in land surface temperatures (LST) in Butwal, especially in urbanized areas. From 2014 to 2023, the average temperature increased from 30.91°C to 32.09°C, with the highest temperature recorded in built-up areas. This trend was closely tied to the expansion of impervious surfaces and the reduction of vegetative cover.</p>
                <h3>Vegetation vs. Built-Up Areas</h3>
                <p>Through NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Building Index), it was found that areas with more vegetation consistently had lower temperatures, while urbanized areas experienced the most significant heat increases. The correlation between LST and urbanization is clear: more buildings lead to more heat.</p>

        <h2>Conclusions & Recommendations</h2>
        <p>The study underscores the importance of sustainable urban planning to mitigate the effects of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) in Butwal. Strategies like increasing green spaces, encouraging green roofs, and utilizing reflective materials in construction can help reduce the heat. Without intervention, temperatures are expected to rise, leading to negative impacts on public health, energy consumption, and the environment.</p>
