                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This study investigates land use and land cover (LULC) changes in Pokhara, Nepal, between 2004 and 2024. The study focuses on the effects of rapid urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural expansion, driven by population growth and economic development. The research utilizes geospatial technologies to track the transitions in forest cover, urban areas, water bodies, and agricultural lands.</p>
                <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyze the spatial and temporal changes in forest cover, urban areas, agricultural lands, and water bodies over two decades.</li>
                    <li>Identify the driving factors behind LULC changes, including population growth, tourism, and infrastructure development.</li>
                    <li>Provide data-driven recommendations for sustainable urban and environmental management to mitigate adverse effects on ecosystems.</li>

        <h2>Analysis & Findings</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <div class="findings">
                <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                <p>The analysis revealed several significant trends in land use and land cover changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Urban Expansion:</strong> Urban areas grew by 130% from 11.34 km² in 2004 to 26.96 km² in 2024, largely at the expense of agricultural and forest lands. The rapid urbanization is primarily driven by population growth and tourism-related developments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Forest cover declined from 40.25% (187.14 km²) in 2004 to 28.27% (131.48 km²) in 2024, leading to a loss of more than 56.66 km². This has serious implications for biodiversity, soil erosion, and the region’s ability to mitigate the effects of climate change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agricultural Expansion:</strong> Cropland fluctuated but overall declined, with significant portions converted into built-up areas due to infrastructure projects and urban sprawl.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Bodies:</strong> Minimal changes were observed in water bodies, although concerns about pollution and sedimentation in Phewa Lake were highlighted due to increased urban runoff.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Conclusions & Recommendations</h2>
        <p>The study highlights the need for immediate intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of rapid urbanization and deforestation. Without sustainable land management, Pokhara's ecosystems, such as Phewa Lake and the surrounding forests, are at risk of further degradation. Policy recommendations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Establishing green belts and buffer zones around critical ecosystems to prevent encroachment.</li>
            <li>Encouraging urban densification to reduce the need for expansion into agricultural and forested areas.</li>
            <li>Promoting sustainable tourism and community-based forest management to involve local populations in conservation efforts.</li>
            <li>Implementing stricter regulations for land use and construction, particularly around water bodies, to prevent pollution and habitat destruction.</li>
        </ul>
